# `online-performance-prediction`

This library allows an intelligent system to decide when to stop thinking and start acting: in particular, the system can use this code to determine when to interrupt an anytime algorithm and act on the current solution by predicting the performance of the anytime algorithm online.

## Run

In order to run the experiments in this paper, you just have to run the following command in a terminal window:
```console
